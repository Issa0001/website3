	<div class="links"></div><p>Gottlieb Daimler was born on March 17, 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith and a stay in France, he attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. After various technical jobs in France and England, he took up a position as a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863 he became a workshop inspector in a machine factory in Reutlingen, where he also met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865.In 1872 he became technical director of the gas engine factory Deutz, where he got to know Otto's four-stroke principle. After differences with the management, he left the company in 1882. Daimler sets up a test workshop in the greenhouse of his villa in Cannstatt and decides to develop engines based on the four-stroke principle that run exclusively on petrol. In 1884, together with Wilhelm Maybach, he succeeded in constructing a combustion engine that is now known as the "grandfather clock". With this construction, which was aimed at saving weight and compact construction, both had created the basis for installation in a vehicle. The expenses for the test operation soon consumed Daimler's entire fortune, so that he had to look for business partners. Together with Max Duttenhofer and his partner Wilhelm Lorenz, he founded the "Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft" on November 28, 1890. But while Duttenhofer wanted to produce stationary engines, Daimler cared about vehicle production and a dispute ensued.</p> </div>
